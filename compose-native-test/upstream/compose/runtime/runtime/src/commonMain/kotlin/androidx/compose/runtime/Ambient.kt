/**
 * Compose passes data through the composition tree explicitly through means of parameters to
 * composable functions. This is often times the simplest and best way to have data flow through
 * the tree.
 *
 * Sometimes this model can be cumbersome or break down for data that is needed by lots of
 * components, or when components need to pass data between one another but keep that implementation
 * detail private. For these cases, [Ambient]s can be used as an implicit way to have data flow
 * through a composition.
 *
 * [Ambient]s by their nature are hierarchical. They make sense when the value of the ambient needs
 * to be scoped to a particular sub-hierarchy of the composition.
 *
 * One must create an Ambient instance, which can be referenced by the consumers statically. Ambient
 * instances themselves hold no data, and can be thought of as a type-safe identifier for the data
 * being passed down a tree. Ambient factory functions takes a single parameter, a factory to
 * create a default value in cases where an ambient is used without a Provider. If this is a
 * situation you would rather not handle, you can throw an error in this factory
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.createAmbient
 *
 * Somewhere up the tree, a [Providers] component can be used, which provides a value for the
 * ambient. This would often be at the "root" of a tree, but could be anywhere, and can also be
 * used in multiple places to override the provided value for a sub-tree.
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.ambientProvider
 *
 * Intermediate components do not need to know about the ambient value, and can have zero
 * dependencies on it. For example, `SomeScreen` might look like this:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.someScreenSample
 *
 * Finally, a component that wishes to consume the ambient value can use the [current]
 * property of the ambient key which returns the current value of the ambient, and subscribes the
 * component to changes of it.
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.runtime.samples.consumeAmbient
